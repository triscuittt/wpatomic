#AtomicWP

A simple, dev-friendly framework for quickly building WordPress plugins.
It gives you lots of creative freedom (aka relatively lightweight for now)

## Some Features Include:

* MVC architecture
* Built-in templating class (using [Dust PHP templating engine](http://cretz.github.io/dust-php/ "Dust PHP A lightweight, powerful templating engine in PHP"))
* Automatically generates an admin page with GET request routing.
* Built-in data table generator (pagination, filtering, sorting, etc.) for your custom DB tables.
* Object-relational mapping

## Contribute

I'm releasing this in hopes that it helps other developers build WP plugins faster.
I also hope to continue to improve it over time and any help would be greatly appreciated.
